FontViewer
==========

My version of the FontViewer application as initially designed and developed in the book [Sams Teach Yourself WPF in 24 Hours](http://www.amazon.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-WPF-Hours/dp/0672329859), with added IntegerUpDown control from [Extended.Wpf.Toolkit](https://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/) NuGet package (for changing the font size).

Disclamer: I'm in no way affiliated with Amazon or this book, I just think it's great, for beginners especially. [This StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9591/what-wpf-books-would-you-recommend) may be useful if searching for a good book on learning WPF.

[FontViewerApplication.zip](FontViewerApplication.zip) contains the exe of the application which you can run, and the FontViewer.sln is the Visual Studio solution.
